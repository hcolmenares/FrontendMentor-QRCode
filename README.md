# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

Hi! This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). I tried to complete this challenge using only the references from the resources and my intuition to determine aspects like padding and border-radius.

## Overview

### Screenshot

This is an example of the component in a "desktop" resolution.

As you can see, the component looks good in mobile resolutions. In this example, the width resolution was set to 375px.

## My process

I am not an expert in designing components, but my process was the following:

1. I created the HTML elements as suggested by Frontend Mentor.
2. Then, I added the style.css sheet.
3. I like to work with variables, so I defined the main variables of my project where I put the colors in hex.
4. After that, I defined the "global aspect" of my project. As I like to work with rem, where 1rem = 10px, I set the font-size in the html to 62.5%.
5. Finally, I created the CSS for the component.

I considered using a "mobile first" approach, but since the component is simple, I decided to use some responsive aspects like relative widths (e.g., 90%) and the use of rem.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to consult some CSS aspects that I forgot while making the challenge.
- [htmlcolors](https://htmlcolors.com/hsl-to-hex) - This is an online tool that helped me to convert HSL to hex.
